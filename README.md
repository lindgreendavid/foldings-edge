A reproducible reanalysis testing whether AlphaFold2's per-residue pLDDT confidence score
predicts experimentally-curated intrinsic disorder (DisProt) — and where that relationship
breaks down.

**Research question:** does AlphaFold2's pLDDT confidence score predict DisProt-curated
intrinsic disorder for human proteins, and where does that relationship break down? This
project is motivated by, but is **not a replication of**, T. Reid Alderson et al.'s 2023 PNAS
paper "Systematic identification of conditionally folded intrinsically disordered regions by
AlphaFold2" (DOI: [10.1073/pnas.2304302120](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2304302120)). It runs
an independent, preregistered test of the same underlying idea — pLDDT vs. curated disorder —
on a fresh 2026 DisProt snapshot joined to real AlphaFold DB predictions, using its own sample,
ground-truth scope, and classifier, and compares its results to that paper only qualitatively.

**Headline finding (v0.1.0):** on 387 human proteins (228,662 residues, 400-of-1,339 fixed-seed
DisProt sample), pLDDT is **substantially lower inside curated disorder regions** (median 45.1
vs. 88.8). The direction survives a protein-level paired sensitivity (median within-protein
difference 36.47, cluster-bootstrap 95% CI 34.29–40.07), so it is not an artifact of treating
all 228,662 correlated residues as independent observations.
A fixed pLDDT<70 classifier catches most curated disorder (76.5% recall) but is a **noisy, only
moderately strong** predictor of it (34.1% precision, F1 0.472, MCC 0.367) — H2 confirmed above
chance, not strongly. The classifier's precision and MCC both drop sharply on disorder regions
that co-occur with a conditional-folding annotation elsewhere on the same protein, and on
disorder supported by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (35.1% recall). Those
subgroup patterns are exploratory and do not establish why performance differs; the overall
direction is only a qualitative match to Alderson et al., not a numerical replication. Full
reasoning, every hypothesis's disposition, and every limitation: see
[`docs/research-report.md`](docs/research-report.md).

## What this contributes

- An independently-run test of the same general relationship a significant published paper
  investigates, using two real, live public data sources joined at reproduction time, rather
  than a restatement of the paper's own claims: does a simple pLDDT<70 classifier actually
  predict curated disorder on a fresh sample, and specifically where does it fail? (Answer: the
  distributional difference is unambiguous; the classifier works better than chance but is far
  from a clean disorder detector, and its worst failures cluster exactly where the motivating
  paper's own theory predicts they should.)
- Two disclosed, real data-access deviations, found and fixed during the actual fetch rather than
  hidden: DisProt's search API ignores `limit`/`offset` under an `organism` filter, and AlphaFold
  DB's metadata endpoint returns UniProt isoform records rather than the long-protein sequence
  fragments this project initially expected. Both are documented in
  [`data/provenance.json`](data/provenance.json) and fixed in
  [`scripts/fetch_data.py`](scripts/fetch_data.py) before any result was generated.
- A concrete, per-protein and per-evidence-code failure analysis, not just an aggregate
  precision/recall number — see `docs/research-report.md` for named examples of both failure
  directions (curated disorder that received confident pLDDT, and non-disorder that received low
  pLDDT).
- What it does **not** contribute: a replication of Alderson et al. (2023)'s exact classifier,
  database combination, or ROC/precision numbers; any claim about AlphaFold3; or any claim about
  intrinsically disordered proteins beyond this specific 387-protein sample.

## Reproduce the analysis locally

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Fetch and join the real data (400-of-1,339 fixed-seed DisProt sample; ~5-10 minutes,
# polite to both live APIs). The committed data/external/joined_residues.csv already
# contains the result of this exact run:
python scripts/fetch_data.py

# Regenerate the registry and confirm it matches the committed one:
python scripts/generate_registry.py --output /tmp/v0.1-foldings-edge-registry.json \
    --residues data/external/joined_residues.csv
cmp reports/v0.1-foldings-edge-registry.json /tmp/v0.1-foldings-edge-registry.json  # should be silent

# Or just summarize the dataset:
foldings-edge summarize data/external/joined_residues.csv
```

This is deterministic given a fixed joined dataset (fixed seed throughout); CI regenerates and
byte-compares the registry from the committed dataset on every push.

## Run the interactive site locally

```bash
cd site
pnpm install
pnpm run dev      # local development server
pnpm run build    # production build (Cloudflare Workers target)
pnpm run test     # build + node --test
pnpm run lint     # eslint
```

`site/wrangler.jsonc` is configured for deployment to Cloudflare Workers as
`foldings-edge-interactive`. This repository does not run `wrangler deploy` — that is a manual
step the maintainer runs after reviewing a build.

## Quality gates

```bash
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy src
pytest                      # includes a 95% coverage gate
python -m build

cd site && pnpm run lint && pnpm run build && pnpm run test
```

## Scope and limitations (short version — full version in the report)

Single DisProt snapshot, human only, 400-of-1,339 fixed-seed sample, 387 proteins after
disclosed exclusions. No claim about AlphaFold3. No claim about intrinsically disordered
proteins beyond this dataset. The "conditional folding" breakdown uses a protein-level proxy,
not Alderson et al.'s own region-level five-database definition. See
[`docs/research-protocol.md`](docs/research-protocol.md#scope-boundaries-declared-before-results)
and [`docs/research-report.md`](docs/research-report.md#limitations) for the complete, disclosed
list.
